# Unreal Engine Platformer Game for Teaching

## Overview

Welcome to our ongoing Unreal Engine platformer game project! This project is being developed in collaboration with a student of mine - Patryk Nowak (PatrykKawon), who currently is in Primary School, and it serves as an introduction to game development using Unreal Engine. Together, we explore the fundamentals of game design, programming, and level creation while having fun building a platformer game.

## About the Game

Our platformer game is an exciting adventure set in a vibrant and dynamic world filled with different creatures, obstacles, and collectibles. The game is set in a 2D environment with various levels and a lot of coins to collect. Each level poses new challenges in terms of monsters and environmental obstacles. But please be aware that the game is still yet to be finished, thus some levels do not exist just yet and some features of the game that we have planned are not yet available.

## Development Progress

We're continuously working on improving and expanding our game with each class session. From one week to another, we add new features, enhance gameplay mechanics, design new levels, and fix bugs to create a more engaging and enjoyable experience for players. Currently, we have finished:
* The overall menu,
* The overall mechanics of the character, collectibles, and score calculation,
* Levels 1-6.

Features that will be added in the near future:
* New enemies (birds and a boss battle - snake)
* Finishing maps of levels 7, 8, and 9.
* Finishing the menu behavior in terms of stars per level and level unlocking.
* Adding options such as POV, brightness, etc.
* Adding options to save the game progress.

## Usage 

* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Open the project in Unreal Engine 5 onwards.
* Compile and run the game to explore the levels and gameplay.

We have also added a short video representing the current state of the game in the repository (GameDemo.mp4), so it can be downloaded and viewed, or it can be viewed below:

## Special Mentions

As the game is solely for the purpose of learning and having fun, some of the graphics used in the game were found on the internet. 
We would especially like to mention the creator of the textures of blocks, the main character, and some of the objects in the game -
<b> Luis Zuno @ansimuz </b>. All of his work is available to the public [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YFvWsiDKBotM7sMRIEvBJmszVkTc90zK/view).

Additionally, we would like to thank the YT creator Cobra Code who got us started with the project by the video that can be found [here](https://youtu.be/g31NTpq9p-o).

Other graphics were generated using AI models or other tools.
